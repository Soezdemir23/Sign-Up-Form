# Sign-up form

Using HTML, CSS, JS.

Vanilla
The site is divided in two parts:

+ left side with the logo and the background and dthe footer
+ right side with the greeting text, form to be filled, submit button and lower text
+ the left side's width is probably 30-40%.
+ the right side then takes the rest.
+ Default screen size should be 1920x1080 or greater.
  + Use clamp to always increase everything along with it.
+ Lower resolution should be clamped down and then we will add @media solutions to clamp it down.
